Welcome to DigiNehruApk Repo!
===================


Hey! this is to develop a native/hybrid app to reduce food wastage in Nehru Mess. 

Benefits of using this app:

----------
>- Food wastage will be minimal as mess workers will know how many students are coming for breakfast/lunch/snacks/dinner. This will surely reduce food wastage, especially on the non-special day.
>- Lesser food wastage -> Proper usage of resource -> Quality of food may become better.
>- You may get your refund on mess fee on approval of HMC as we'll have data who have taken food and who haven't on daily basis.
>- There are many phases of this project:
i) Collection of data (which is currently going on)
ii) Optimization of cooked food so that wastage can be minimal.
>- Added features through app which will be in next sem.
>- You won't need to keep coupons for different subscription of Milk/Egg/Extra-Meal. It will be all through one app when it'll be fully developed.
>- You can see the mess menu on daily basis and also you can put your feedback/comment on food which will be directly monitored by Mess Warden.
